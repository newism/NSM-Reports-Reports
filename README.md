NSM Reports
===========

The contents of this repository requires [NSM Reports](http://ee-garage.com/nsm-reports) to function.

Overview
--------

We offer free reports to extend your NSM Reports ExpressionEngine addon.

The reports provided here are useful for both the website administrators using NSM Reports and the developers who write custom reports using NSM Reports as their reports development platform.

These reports have been written to collect more data from your website in ways that we hope will inspire developers to create even more impressive reports!

Each sub-directory contains a different report that can be installed into the  NSM Reports dashboard (installation instructions below).

Contents
--------

* New Members (new_members_report): See new memberships within a date range and visualise the increase with graphs using the Google Charts API.

Installation
------------

* Copy the report directory that you wish to install into your NSM Reports report path. By default this will be the system/expressionengine/third_party/nsm_reports/reports directory unless it has been set in the NSM Reports [extension settings](http://ee-garage.com/nsm-reports/user-guide#toc-configuration:extension_settings:general_settings) or the site's config_bootstrap.php
* The report will now appear in the NSM Reports [dashboard](http://ee-garage.com/nsm-reports#toc-take_a_peek_:multiple_reports)
